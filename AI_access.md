# Access Azure OpenAI for Hack Together, for Free!

**We've made it quick and easy to get access to Azure OpenAI models for the duration of Hack Together!**

By using our Azure OpenAI Proxy service you'll get access to keys and endpoints that work just like the real ones you get from using the Azure Portal and Azure OpenAI Studio to deploy your own models. 

When you get access to Azure OpenAI yourself, all you need to do is switch over your endpoints and keys to get up and running on your own resources
