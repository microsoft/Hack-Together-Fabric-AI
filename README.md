![The Microsoft Fabric Global AI HackTogether Banner](./images/logo.png)

## Introduction

🛠️Build, innovate, and #HackTogether!🛠️ It's time to get started building AI solutions with Microsoft Fabric. 🔥

The Microsoft Fabric Global AI Hack is your playground for creating and experimenting with Microsoft Fabric. With mentorship from Microsoft experts and access to the latest tech, you will learn how to build AI solutions with Microsoft Fabric! The possibilities are endless for what you can create... plus you can submit your hack for a chance to win exciting prizes! 🥳

The hackathon starts on **February 15th** and ends on **February 29** (just ahead of the [Microsoft Fabric Community Conference](https://fabricconf.com/)) - where one lucky winner will secure the honor of presenting to attendees during the Power Hour event!). It is recommended for participants to follow the Hack Together Roadmap for a successful hackathon.

### #03 - Submit your project until March 3rd 23:59 PM PST

You may submit your project here when it's ready: 🚀 [Project Submission](https://github.com/microsoft/hack-together-fabric-ai/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=project.yml&title=Project%3A+%3Cshort+description%3E)

TODO: Update to support Fabric + AI Hack
Check out this video for step by step project submission guidance: [Project Submission Video](https://github.com/microsoft/hack-together-teams/assets/3199282/572ea387-61ec-4b77-9885-23b5b2bd39bd)

There will be a grand prize winner out of all projects as well as a 'Best Real-World AI application built with Microsoft Fabric', 'Best use of Microsoft Fabric + Azure OpenAI', and 'Best use of Copilot for Microsoft Fabric' so it is important to align your hack to one of these categories.

TODO add link to community site for discussion
We'd love to hear about your project, tell us what you are working on!

For a great example of a community developed solution that demonstrates a high-quality submission for this Hackathon, check out:  

[Tracking International Space Station with Microsoft Fabric](https://github.com/anshulsharmas/fabric-iss-demo)

This solution is a great example because it:
* Solves a real-world problem in a novel way using Microsoft Fabric
* Is shared publicly via a GitHub repo
* Has clear documentation and instructions to reproduce the solution 
* Includes a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HhU7yLyuUU) demonstrating the solution in action

That said, this solution could be better aligned to the Hackathon by:
* Incorporating Azure OpenAI into the solution
* Making use of Copilot for Fabric features

## Judging and Prizes 🏆

Projects will be evaluated by a panel of judges, including Microsoft executives, product managers, and developer advocates. Judging criteria will include alignment with corresponding hackathon category, documentation / reusability, and innovation / impact (defined in more detail below).

The winning teams will receive the following exciting prizes (up to 3 individuals if submitting as a team, prizes distributed per team). Winning solutions and/or product feedback may also be considered for integration into the Microsoft Fabric product roadmap. One lucky grand prize winner will have the opportunity to showcase their project to attendees during the Power Hour session at the upcoming [Microsoft Fabric Community Conference](https://fabricconf.com/).

**🏆 Grand Prize winner:** _The best of the best! This category rewards the solution that meets all judging criteria, wows judges, has potential real-world value, and demonstrates innovative use of Artificial Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric._
